						li.mb-2 Location data is extremely imprecise, sometimes off by over 300 feet, especially indoors. Zerobase not only pinpoints the exact locations of community touchpoints, it is designed to focus on the specific high-traffic areas where the virus is most likely to spread - for example, inside buildings.
