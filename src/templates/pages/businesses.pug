          h2 What is Zerobase? 
          p Zerobase is a tool used by state and local health officials to pinpoint individuals likeliest to next develop COVID-19. Zerobase uses anonymized predictive technology to help protect communities before an outbreak occurs, enabling officials to best allocate their resources, eliminating guesswork, and reducing illness and fear.

          h2 How much does it cost? 
          p Zerobase is being offered without charge. It has been organized as a nonprofit effort and labor has been donated.

          h2 Who is building Zerobase? 
          p Zerobase was created by a team of volunteer technologists and medical professionals concerned about the spread of coronavirus among their fellow citizens. Using local data, their program traces the likely path of travel of the virus, identifying the next prospective patients before illness can spread further.

          h2 How does it work? 
          p Local governments work with businesses, places of worship, and other gathering spaces in their communities to post a QR code at the entrance or another obvious highly trafficked spot. Individuals visiting those locations scan the QR code on their way in and their information is then anonymized and analyzed to ascertain likely patterns of spread in that community. The data builds up invisible networks of interaction among people. If someone tests positive, the program can inform local health authorities of the next likely people to contract and spread illness. Patients and prospective patients are informed anonymously via their cell phones. The more data that is collected and aggregated, the more accurate its predictive properties. Over time, communities deploying Zerobase help sister communities to be even better prepared for viral spread.

          h2 What information is collected by Zerobase? 
          p An individualâ€™s identity is never known by the system. Personally identifying information is therefore not stored and not subject to discovery by any other party.

          h2 What do participating businesses and public locations need to do? 
          p Participating businesses and public locations simply use a designated smartphone to enroll, print out a QR code and request that every individual entering the premises scan the code.

          h2 What technological resources does Zerobase require? 
          p A computer and a printer is all that is required for local public health efforts to activate Zerobase. Individual community members only need a cell phone.
