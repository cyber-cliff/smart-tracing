									strong Because it’s your community’s first line of defense.
									|     Zerobase deploys contact tracing across a community in a way that is anonymous, fast, and easy to use. You can allocate your time and resources more efficiently, elevating your community’s ability to contain the virus. We provide you with a powerful way to instantaneously track interactions with exposed individuals without invading their privacy.

									|     Zerobase empowers you to take action with conviction, such as recommending that an exposed individual self-quarantine or be registered for a COVID-19 test. Zerobase is also an early warning system to alert you when an outbreak begins so that you can avoid a blanket lockdown while quickly and effectively deploying strategic public health resources to the places that need them the most.

									|     The sooner you partner with Zerobase, the stronger your check-in data repository becomes, allowing you to make each test administered within your community exponentially more powerful, especially in places with critical public health resource limitations.

									strong Because contact tracing contains outbreaks.
									|     Research demonstrates that real-time contact tracing is enough to control an outbreak of COVID-19 in a matter of weeks. If an individual is exposed to COVID-19, contact tracing allows us to pinpoint any number of others who were in the same place – such as a community center – as the exposed individual. Community healthcare providers, with the help of Zerobase, can then provide personalized recommendations to potentially-affected people in order to stop the spread with precision.

									strong Because it reduces resurgence.
									|     Zerobase helps contain the spread of infection and resurgence through automated notifications of an individual’s interactions when they are likely infected. Epidemiologists have found that minimizing the time between symptom onset and isolation is the most critical part of controlling an outbreak. Zerobase detects possible exposure to the virus days before symptoms begin, and can recommend proactive isolation that will prevent a resurgence without resorting to a full lockdown.
