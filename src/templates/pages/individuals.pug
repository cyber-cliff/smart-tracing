          h2 Q&A about Zerobase for Individuals

          h2 What is Zerobase? 
          p Zerobase is a tool used by state and local health officials to pinpoint individuals likeliest to next develop COVID-19. Zerobase uses anonymized predictive technology to help protect communities before an outbreak occurs, enabling officials to best allocate their resources, eliminating guesswork, and reducing illness and fear.

          h2 How Much Does It Cost? 
          p Zerobase is being offered without charge. It has been organized as a nonprofit effort and labor has been donated.

          h2 Who is building Zerobase? 
          p Zerobase was created by a team of volunteer technologists and medical professionals concerned about the spread of coronavirus among their fellow communities. Using local data, their program traces the likely path of travel of the virus, identifying the next prospective patients before illness can spread further.

          h2 How does it work? 
          p Local governments work with businesses, places of worship, and other gathering spaces in their communities to post a QR code at the entrance or another obvious highly trafficked spot. Individuals visiting those locations scan the QR code on their way in and their information is then anonymized and analyzed to ascertain likely patterns of spread in that community. The data builds up invisible networks of interaction among people. If someone tests positive, the program can inform local health authorities of the next likely people to contract and spread illness. Patients and prospective patients are informed anonymously via their cell phones. The more data that is collected and aggregated, the more accurate its predictive properties. Over time, communities deploying Zerobase help sister communities to be even better prepared for viral spread.

          h2 What information is collected by Zerobase? 
          p Your identity is never known by Zerobase. Zerobase uses technology through QR scans to track where your phone has been, but it will never ask for your email, your name, address, or other identifying information. You can provide your phone number to receive notifications, but Zerobase will not use it for any other purpose. Personally identifying information is therefore not stored and not subject to discovery by any other party. See our privacy policy here [future link to privacy policy]. How do I use Zerobase? When entering a participating business or public location, or health care provider, scan the displayed QR code. For most people, this is as simple as pointing their phone’s camera at the sign, it takes just a few seconds, and no app installation is required.

          h2 What if my phone cannot automatically scan the QR code? 
          p If your default camera app does not have QR scanning ability, you can go to the zerobase.io website and click scan from the dropdown menu. What technological resources does Zerobase require? A computer and a printer is all that is required for local public health efforts to activate Zerobase. Individual community members only need a cell phone to go to the website https://zerobase.io. Do I have to install an app to use Zerobase? No. To use Zerobase, simply scan the QR code on your phone at one of your community’s locations, or go to the Zerobase website which will automatically enroll you.

          p Will I be notified if I’m at risk of exposure? You will only be notified if you provide your phone number to Zerobase or download the Zerobase Notification App. We will only use your phone number for the purpose of notifying you as to whether you are at risk of exposure.
